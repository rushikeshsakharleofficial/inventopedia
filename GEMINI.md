## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes â€” gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review â€” token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.

## code-outline-graph MCP Tools

This project is indexed with [code-outline-graph](https://github.com/rushikeshsakharleofficial/code-outline-graph). MCP server name: `code-outline`. Use these tools instead of reading source files directly (10x–50x fewer tokens).

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `resolve_edit_target(description)` | Find function/class by natural language — returns signatures only, no body |
| `read_symbol_body(name, file)` | Read one symbol's source lines (never the full file) |
| `list_outline(file)` | All symbols + line ranges in a file |
| `get_outline_summary(file)` | Compressed signatures view |
| `find_by_keyword(query)` | Search all indexed symbol names |
| `get_file_header(file)` | Imports + top-level constants only |
| `get_symbol(name)` | Exact symbol metadata |
| `get_line_range(file, start, end)` | Read arbitrary line slice |
| `update_project(path?)` | Reindex changed files |
| `prune_project(path?)` | Remove stale rows for deleted or ignored files |

Fall back to direct file reads only if these return empty results.

**After every code change:** run `code-outline-graph update .` to keep the index current.
